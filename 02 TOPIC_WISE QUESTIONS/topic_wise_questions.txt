       Output: You are old enough to learn to drive.
       Enter your age: 15
       Output: You need 3 more years to learn to drive.

   Example:
       Enter your age: 30
       Output: You are 5 years older than me.

       Enter number one: 4
       Enter number two: 3
       Output: 4 is greater than 3

   Example:
       fruits = ['banana', 'orange', 'mango', 'lemon']
   If a fruit doesn't exist in the list, add the fruit to the list and print the modified list. If the fruit exists, print 'That fruit already exists in the list'.


7. Here we have a person dictionary. Feel free to modify it!
   person = {
       'first_name': 'Asabeneh',

       }
   }
   - Check if the person dictionary has a skills key, if so print out the middle skill in the skills list.
   - Check if the person dictionary has a skills key, if so check if the person has 'Python' skill and print out the result.
