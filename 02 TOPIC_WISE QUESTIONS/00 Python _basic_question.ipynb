    "\n",
    "To optimize Python code for better performance, start by identifying the slow parts using **profiling tools** like **cProfile** or **timeit**. These tools help pinpoint which functions or sections of code take the most time to run. Next, focus on using more efficient **data structures** like **sets** for fast lookups or **NumPy arrays** for handling large amounts of numerical data more efficiently. Avoid using **global variables** as much as possible, as they slow down execution; instead, use **local variables** within functions for faster performance. Whenever possible, take advantage of **Python’s built-in functions**—they are optimized and run faster than custom-written solutions. For tasks that require a lot of processing power, you can use **multiprocessing** to run tasks in parallel, speeding up execution. Finally, for handling large datasets, use **generators** instead of lists to save memory and improve performance. By combining these strategies, you can significantly speed up your Python code and make it more efficient.\n",
