# =======================================================TASK MANAGER 03 ======================================================
# Application 03:

# Personal Budget Tracker:
#     Define the Menu: Display the options available to the user.

# Define Functions for Each Operation:

#     View all transactions
#     Add a new transaction
#     Edit an existing transaction
#     Delete a transaction
#     View the total balance

# Implement the Main Loop: Continuously prompt the user to choose an option and perform the corresponding action until they choose to exit.

# Expected Functions:
#     display_menu(): Prints the main menu.
#     view_transactions(transactions): Displays all transactions with their categories, amounts, and descriptions.
#     add_transaction(transactions): Prompts the user to enter a transaction category, amount, and description, then adds the transaction to the list.
#     edit_transaction(transactions): Allows the user to modify an existing transactionâ€™s details based on its index or title.
#     delete_transaction(transactions): Deletes a transaction by its index or title if it exists in the list.
#     view_balance(transactions): Calculates and displays the total balance, which is the sum of all transactions.
#     main(): Runs the main loop, displaying the menu and handling user input to perform the appropriate actions.
