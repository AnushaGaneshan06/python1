#     view_transactions(transactions): Displays all transactions with their categories, amounts, and descriptions.
#     add_transaction(transactions): Prompts the user to enter a transaction category, amount, and description, then adds the transaction to the list.
#     edit_transaction(transactions): Allows the user to modify an existing transactionâ€™s details based on its index or title.
#     delete_transaction(transactions): Deletes a transaction by its index or title if it exists in the list.
#     view_balance(transactions): Calculates and displays the total balance, which is the sum of all transactions.
#     main(): Runs the main loop, displaying the menu and handling user input to perform the appropriate actions.
